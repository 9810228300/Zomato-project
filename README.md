# Zomato-project
This project involved analyzing Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. The project provided valuable insights into restaurant industry trends related to location, opening trends, ratings, and price ranges.
This project was all about looking at Zomato restaurant data to learn interesting things. We wanted to see where the restaurants are, when they open, how good they are, and how much they cost. Here's what we did:
1.	We made tables that show which countries and cities have the most restaurants.
2.	We made a calendar to organize dates and figure out trends like which months or quarters have the most restaurant openings.
3.	We counted how many restaurants there are in different places and how they're rated on average.
4.	We divided restaurants into price categories and saw how many fall into each category.
5.	We looked at which restaurants offer things like table booking and online delivery.
6.	We made charts that show things like popular cuisines, restaurant ratings, and more.
To do all this, we used some fancy stuff in Excel, like functions to sum and count data, pivot tables to summarize information, and formatting to make things clear. We also used SQL to grab the data we needed from Zomato's database. And to make it all look nice, we used Power BI and Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
So, basically, we dug into Zomato's data to find cool insights about restaurants using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. It's a neat project for anyone wanting to learn about analyzing data!
